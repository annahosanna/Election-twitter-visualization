# Political “Buzz” and the Race for the White House

A visualization of political buzz on twitter using d3.

## Using the visualization
Map: Our map represents the results of the 2016 political primaries.  Using the dropdown menu, choose either a specific candidate or a political party to view.
If a candidate is selected, states are colored according to the percentage of votes won by that candidate in a state.  Mouseover a state to see the percentage won by the chosen candidate in that state.
If a party is selected, states are colored according to the winner of that state’s primary.  Mouseover a state to see a breakdown of all the candidates who competed in that state’s primary.
*Dark grey indicates that either a state’s primary has not yet occurred or the selected candidate did not compete in that primary.

Themeriver: Our themeriver represents the amount of twitter buzz surrounding each candidate over the course of the primary season.
Each “stream” of color represents a different candidate, and the width of the stream represents the amount of times a candidate's name was mentioned or a tweet with a character's name was interacted with.
Click on a state to view the twitter data for that specific state in the themeriver. Click the reset button (next to the themeriver) to return to the original view of the twitter data for the entire country.
Mouseover any state and the themeriver will highlight the section in which that state’s primary took place.
